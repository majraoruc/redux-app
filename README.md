# MY REDUX APP

Here's me using redux for the first time :D
It's a simple page done with some basic functionalities that Redux offers.
In my case, it is a page with a few songs and some details relevant to said songs.

# How to set it up

1. Clone the repository https://github.com/majraoruc/redux-app.git
2. Open in VS Code or any other editor of your choice (I prefer VSCode)
3. ```  npm install  ```
4. ```  npm start  ```
